Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: "It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. The judges called it "an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens". The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Small Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers.
