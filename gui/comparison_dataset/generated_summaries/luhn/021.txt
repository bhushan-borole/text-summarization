With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. They are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages.

Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping.
