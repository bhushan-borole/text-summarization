This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections.
