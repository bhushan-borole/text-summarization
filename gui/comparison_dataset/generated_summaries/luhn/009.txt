The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells.
