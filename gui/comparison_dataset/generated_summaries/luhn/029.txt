This is a view corroborated by the UK Patent Office. There are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the US and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. The attack on software patents comes at a time when IBM has made 500 of its patents freely available. Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. Other companies are expected to follow suit.
