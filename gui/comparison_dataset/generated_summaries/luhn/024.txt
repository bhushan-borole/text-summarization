The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification. The Canada-based company says it was looking for "a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters". She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. She added: "Not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games."
