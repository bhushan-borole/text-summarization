Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.
