Warning over tsunami aid website Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.
