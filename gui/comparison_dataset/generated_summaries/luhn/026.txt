Warnings about junk mail deluge The amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase, say experts. The program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. The amount of spam in circulation was still growing, said Mr Stanley, but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. The PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. Steve Linford, director of Spamhaus, predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's e-mail sending infrastructure.
