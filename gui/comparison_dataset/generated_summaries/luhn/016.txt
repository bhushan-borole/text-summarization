Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (Â£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956.
