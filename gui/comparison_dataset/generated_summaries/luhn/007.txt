The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover.
