Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were "respectable" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier.
