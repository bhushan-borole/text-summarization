TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding. Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google.
