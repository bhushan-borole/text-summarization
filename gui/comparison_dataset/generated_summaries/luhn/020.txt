The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance. The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed "the noble savage" when he arrived in London from Polynesia. The exhibition of Reynolds' work will be shown at Tate Britain from May. The Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK. The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition.
