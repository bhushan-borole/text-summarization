Dollar gains on Greenspan speech The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise . On Friday , Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan 's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data . `` I think the chairman 's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he 's taken for some time , '' said Robert Sinche , head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York . In the meantime , the US Federal Reserve 's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates . The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits , as well as the US 's yawning current account gap , both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments .
