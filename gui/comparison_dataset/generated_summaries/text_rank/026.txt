Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent . But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place . As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical , Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped . Steve Linford , director of Spamhaus , predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net 's e-mail sending infrastructure . The amount of spam in circulation was still growing , said Mr Stanley , but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown .
