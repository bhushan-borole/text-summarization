The auction , at Sotheby 's , will feature 45 contemporary , impressionist and 19th Century paintings . One of the highlights of the sale is Roy Lichtenstein 's Blue Nude which has been given an estimate of Â£1.8m ( $ 3.4m ) . Tobias Meyer , Sotheby 's worldwide head of contemporary art , said : `` This collection reflects Mr Versace 's wide-ranging taste and impeccable eye , and many of the works were commissioned directly from the artists . `` Outstanding later examples from champions of the Pop movement , such as Roy Lichtenstein , are juxtaposed with masterpieces from the most visible artists of the 1980 's , including Jean-Michel Basquiat and the collaborative genius of Basquiat and Warhol , as well as Francesco Clemente . '' Much of the collection will be offered for sale at three auctions in New York in June , with smaller contemporary paintings going under the hammer in London on 22 and 23 June .
