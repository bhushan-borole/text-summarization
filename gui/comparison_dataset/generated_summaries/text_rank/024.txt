Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer 's fee for the use of their image . The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton , Alberta , on Friday and Saturday , bringing along a piece of photo identification . She added : `` Not everyone is a model in the world so we do n't want just models in our games . '' People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions . `` But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one , the villain in another and just a merchant in a third .
