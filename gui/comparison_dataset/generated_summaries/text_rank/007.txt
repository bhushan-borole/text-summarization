Jobs growth still slow in the US The US created fewer jobs than expected in January , but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years . The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office . He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November 's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover . The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004 , from 157,000 to 133,000 . `` The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth , '' said Ken Mayland , president of ClearView Economics .
