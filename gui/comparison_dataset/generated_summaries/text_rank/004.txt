Rod Eddington , BA 's chief executive , said the results were `` respectable '' in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3 % . BA 's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m , and it expects a rise in full-year revenues . To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel , BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers . Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3 % to £1.97bn , further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue . `` For the year to March 2005 , the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3 % to 3.5 % improvement anticipated , '' BA chairman Martin Broughton said .
