Court rejects $ 280bn tobacco case A US government claim accusing the country 's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court . The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws . In its case , the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction , targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns , lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary . But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business . The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public .
