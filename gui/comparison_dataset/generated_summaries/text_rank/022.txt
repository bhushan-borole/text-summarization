Sun offers processing by the hour Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour . Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity . The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil , gas and financial services industries . The Sun Grid relies on Solaris , the operating system owned by Sun . It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM , which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun .
