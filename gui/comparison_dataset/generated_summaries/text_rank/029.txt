Open source leaders slam patents The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents . `` Some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca n't afford to take them to court , '' said Dr Jeremy Philpott of the UK Patent Office . `` If totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software ... of course they 're going to unleash the WMDs , '' Mr Kapor is reported as saying . Microsoft did not want to comment directly , referring the issue instead to trade body Intellect , of which it is a member . `` The industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software , '' `` We think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents , copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries , and not be forced into using one or the other , '' she added .
