Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim The owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $ 900m ( Â£479m ) loan . State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $ 9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $ 27.5bn tax claim against Yukos . But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk . Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm . Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale .
