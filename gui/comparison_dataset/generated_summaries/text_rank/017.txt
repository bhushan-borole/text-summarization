Spark heads world Booker list Dame Muriel Spark is among three British authors who have made the shortlist for the inaugural international Booker Prize . McEwan and Margaret Atwood are the only nominees to have previously won the main Booker Prize . But other past winners of the regular Booker Prize , such as Salman Rushdie , JM Coetzee and Kazuo Ishiguro have failed to make the shortlist . It will reward an author - who must be living - for `` continued creativity , development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage '' . The international award was started in response to criticisms that the Booker Prize is only open to British and Commonwealth authors .
