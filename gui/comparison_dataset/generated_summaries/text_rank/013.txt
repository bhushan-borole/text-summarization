She is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating Booker winner Alan Hollinghurst 's The Line of Beauty . Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children 's fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World . All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title , which carries with it a Â£25,000 prize . As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread . She has previously been the winner of the Blue Peter Book of the Year .
