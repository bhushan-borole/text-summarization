The Legal Affairs Committee ( JURI ) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it . The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect , in other words , `` computer implemented invention '' . The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland , one of the largest EU member states , rejected its adoption twice in two months . Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states . In the US , the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted .
