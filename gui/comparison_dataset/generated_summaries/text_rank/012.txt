The Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a `` very dilapidated condition '' . Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of `` healthy , wealthy Irish Americans '' in one room and ask them to help with fundraising . The Oscar-nominated actor , whose films include Schindler 's List , Michael Collins and Star Wars : The Phantom Menace , said : `` The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart . `` There was serious trouble , as you know , but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week , doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do . '' He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a `` very dynamic , extraordinary figure '' .
