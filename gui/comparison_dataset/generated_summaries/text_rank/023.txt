Lasers help bridge network gaps An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country . `` In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task , '' said Mr R. Sridharan , vice president of networks at Tata . The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network . The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses . The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working , said Mr Sridharan .
