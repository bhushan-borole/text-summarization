The Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK . The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition . The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country , but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance . In March 2004 , the Tate managed to raise Â£12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since . The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed `` the noble savage '' when he arrived in London from Polynesia .
